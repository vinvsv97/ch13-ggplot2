# Exercise-4

# Set up: load `dplyr` and `ggplot2`
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read, and then `source` the data-prep.R file. The `all.data` variable is now available
source("data-prep.R")

# Create a column of percentage of registered voters who voted
all.data <- all.data %>% mutate(percentage = total.voted * 100 / registered.voters)

# Start by making a new `ggplot` with `all.data` as the data (no geometry yet)
# What do you see?


# Draw a scatter plot (with point geometry) with for the `all.data` set, 
# with the `total.population` mapped to the x-position and `registerd.voters` mapped to the y-position.


# Draw a scatter plot (with point geometry) with for the `all.data` set, 
# with the `total.population` mapped to the x-position and `pct.voted` mapped to the y-position.
# Color the points as "blue"


# Create the same scatter plot as above, but put the county names where the dots are

# Draw a scatter plot comparing the female percentage to the percent voted
# Size the points by the population of the county


# Draw a line graph comparing the total population to the percent male
# Make it a green line
